# Chapter III – Operators and Expressions in Python

Operators in Python are **symbols** that perform operations on variables and values.  
An **expression** is a combination of operators and operands that produces a value.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3` | `8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 4` | `6` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `6 * 2` | `12` |
| `/` | Division (float) | `7 / 2` | `3.5` |
| `//` | Floor Division | `7 // 2` | `3` |
| `%` | Modulus (remainder) | `7 % 2` | `1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation (power) | `2 ** 3` | `8` |

## 2. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.  
They can also perform operations and update the variable in a single step.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Equivalent | Answer |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| `=`  | Assign value | `x = 5` | `x = 5` | `x = 5` |
| `+=` | Add & assign | `x = 5; x += 3` | `x = x + 3` | `x = 8` |
| `-=` | Subtract & assign | `x = 5; x -= 2` | `x = x - 2` | `x = 3` |
| `*=` | Multiply & assign | `x = 5; x *= 4` | `x = x * 4` | `x = 20` |
| `/=` | Divide & assign | `x = 5; x /= 2` | `x = x / 2` | `x = 2.5` |
| `//=` | Floor divide & assign | `x = 5; x //= 2` | `x = x // 2` | `x = 2` |
| `%=` | Modulus & assign | `x = 5; x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` | `x = 2` |
| `**=` | Power & assign | `x = 5; x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2` | `x = 25` |

## 3. Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare values. They return **True** or **False**.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` | `True` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` | `True` |
| `>` | Greater than | `7 > 3` | `True` |
| `<` | Less than | `4 < 2` | `False` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5` | `True` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `3 <= 5` | `True` |

 **Real-world use:**  
Often used in **if conditions** to make decisions (e.g., "Is age >= 18?").

---

## 4. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `and` | True if both are true | `(5 > 2 and 3 < 4)` | `True` |
| `or` | True if at least one is true | `(5 > 10 or 3 < 4)` | `True` |
| `not` | Reverses result | `not(5 > 2)` | `False` |

 **Real-world use:**  
- `and` ensures **all conditions must be true**.  
- `or` allows **any one condition to be true**.  
- `not` is used for **negating conditions**.

---

## 5. Membership Operators
Used to test if a sequence (like string, list, tuple, set, dict) contains a value.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `in` | True if value exists | `"a" in "apple"` | `True` |
| `not in` | True if value does not exist | `"x" not in "apple"` | `True` |

 **Real-world use:**  
- Checking if a user is in a list of registered users.  
- Verifying if a word exists in a document.  

---

## 6. Identity Operators
Used to compare **object references** (memory location), not just values.

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Output |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `is` | True if both refer to the same object | `a is b` | Depends |
| `is not` | True if both refer to different objects | `a is not b` | Depends |

⚠️ **Important:**  
- `==` checks **value equality**.  
- `is` checks **object identity** (same memory location).  

Example:
```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)
print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)
```

---

## 7. Operator Precedence
When multiple operators appear in an expression, precedence decides which is executed first.

Example:

```python
x = 10 + 3 * 2
print(x)  # 16 (3*2 first, then 10+6)
```
**Precedence order (highest → lowest):**

1. `()` Parentheses
2. `**` Exponentiation
3. `* / // %` Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus
4. `+ -` Addition, Subtraction
5. `< <= > >=` Comparisons
6. `== !=` Equality
7. `and`
8. `or`
9. `=` Assignment

---

## 8. Operator Associativity

If two operators have the same precedence, associativity decides the order.

- Most operators are left-to-right.
- Exponentiation (`**`) is right-to-left.

Example:
```python
print(2 ** 3 ** 2)  # 512 (2 ** (3 ** 2))
```

---

## 9. Expressions
An **expression** is any valid combination of operators and operands that produces a value.

Examples:

```python
5 + 3       # Arithmetic expression → 8
x > 5 and y < 10   # Logical expression → True/False
"a" in "apple"     # Membership expression → True
```
 If it produces a value, it is an expression.

---

## 10. Statements
A **statement** is a complete instruction to be executed.

It may or may not produce a value.

Python executes programs as a series of statements.

Examples:

```python
x = 5        # Assignment statement
if x > 3:    # If statement
    print("Hello")  # Print statement
```
**Difference:**

- Expression: `5 + 3` → produces a value (8).
- Statement: `x = 5 + 3` → complete instruction, assigns value to variable.
