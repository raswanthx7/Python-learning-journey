- Identifiers
- Commands
- Input/Output Statements

##  Literals
Literals are fixed values in Python. They represent data directly.

### Examples:
```python
# Numeric literal
num = 10  

# String literal
name = "Raswanth"  

# Boolean literal
is_active = True  

# Float literal
pi = 3.14  
```

---

## Constants
-Constants are variables whose values should not change during the program.
(Python does not have true constants, but by convention we write them in UPPERCASE).

### Example:
```python
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
```

## Variables
- A variable is a name that stores a value.
- It is created using the = assignment operator.

### Example:
```python
age = 20
user_name = "Raswanth"
```

**Here:**
- age → identifier (variable name)
- 20 → literal (value)

---

## Keywords
- Keywords are reserved words in Python.
- We cannot use them as variable names.

### Example:
```python
# Wrong: using keyword as variable
# if = 10   ❌ Invalid

# Correct usage
count = 10
```
Some keywords: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `True`, `False`, `None`.

---

## Identifiers
Identifiers are the names we give to variables, functions, classes, etc.

**Rules for identifiers:**

- Can contain letters, digits, and _ (underscore).
- Cannot start with a digit.
- Cannot use keywords.
- Case sensitive.

### Example:
```python
user_name = "Raswanth"   # valid
Age = 20                 # valid (different from 'age')
2num = 30                # ❌ invalid
```

---

## Commands
Comments are notes in code, ignored by Python.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
Useful for documentation
"""

print("Hello World")  # Inline comment
```
---

## Input / Output Statements
**Output**
We use `print()` to display output.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Input**
We use input() to take input from the user.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome,", name)

#example2
age = input("Enter your age: ")   # input statement
print("Your age is:", age)        # output statement
```
