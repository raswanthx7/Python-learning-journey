# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my step-by-step journey of learning Python. I am practicing Python programming directly on **Linux Terminal**, writing and executing scripts in **interactive mode** and **script mode**, and documenting my learning using Markdown files. Each chapter contains notes, explanations, and practical Python examples to build a strong foundation for **automation, cloud computing, and scripting**. This repository also helps me track my progress and demonstrate my coding skills professionally.
